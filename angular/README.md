#TOERH - CLIENT

NOTE: The API is currently NOT available online (due to trouble with Heroku). See instructions [here](https://github.com/alexicon79/1DV450_ah222tz/blob/master/README.md) for details on how to get the API up and running on a local machine.

##CLIENT INSTALLATION

Make sure the API-server is running locally and that you have seeded fresh data into the database. Then go to the root folder of the client application and run the following command to start the client server:
```
  scripts/web-server.js
```
You can now access the application through http://localhost:8000/app/index.html
